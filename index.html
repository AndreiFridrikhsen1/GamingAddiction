    <h1>Gaming Addiction</h1>
    <h3>Photo Essay by Liam Moore, Andrei Fridrikhsen, Jordan Chevalier, Cameron Carbone  </h3>
    <section>
        <h2> Gaming addiction</h2>
        <p>The photo in slide one shows a man ignoring his wife because he is too busy playing video games. This photo illustrates how gaming can take away from quality time with family/significant other.</p>
        <p>The photo in slide two is a photo of the messy room of a gamer. This is to demonstrate the point that gaming can distract from hygiene and cleanliness. When one is addicted to gaming, they will lose focus for important things like cleaning their room</p>
        <p>The photo in slide three is a diagram of a tendon injury. This is to show how repeated strain in the hands from gripping a controller or spamming keyboard keys can cause injury in the hand. This can be a legitimate risk to chronic gamers and is one of the many downsides of gaming.</p>
        <p>The photo in slide four is a picture of a calendar full of gaming. There is virtually no room for eating and sleeping (the most basic and essential forms of self-care) because the entire week is filled with gaming. This directly demonstrates the point of our essay that the whole life of people addicted to gaming suffers from too much gaming</p>
        <p>The photos in slide five show a comparison between time spent outside in nature, and time spent inside gaming. Without showing any science on the effects of sunlight or fresh air, or the benefits of physical activity, you can clearly see how much healthier it is to spend time outside over gaming through these pictures alone. This precisely relates to our thesis, as it directly shows how gaming is unhealthy. </p>
        <p>The photo in slide six is an MRI scan of a healthy brain, as well as a brain addicted to gaming. This demonstrates that gaming addiction is a real thing, and that it negatively impacts the brain. </p>
        <p>The photo on slide seven shows a student sleeping in the classroom, while others are studying. This photo is a good example of how gaming addiction can negatively impact academic performance. Staying up late on a school night playing games leads to less focus in the classroom, and in this case could even lead to falling asleep in the classroom.  </p>
        <p>The photo on slide eight shows an office worker who is in distress. The tone of the photograph perfectly conveys a somber atmosphere showing the impact of excessive gaming on performance in the workplace. </p>
        <p>The photo on slide nine shows a person who is taking the game too seriously. This highlights how anger inducing gaming can be and can build up stress, causing unhealthy emotional outbursts. </p>
        <p>The photos on slide ten demonstrate how the rise of online gaming has impacted the socialization of the youth today. The first photo shows two friends hanging out playing games together, and in the second photo the kid is alone playing with “friends” online instead. The light in the first photo and the dark in the second photo demonstrates the contrast, and the feeling of loneliness solitude in the second photo.</p>
        <p>The photo in slide eleven shows a man, eating fast food while playing video games. This shows how when one is focused on playing games, other areas in their life such as diet get neglected.</p>
        <p>The photos in slide twelve show kids playing together outside, compared to a kid playing alone inside. This really demonstrates the isolation that gaming addiction causes, and how it can truly take away from one’s childhood experience.  </p>
        <p>The photo in slide thirteen represents the decline in physical health due to gaming addiction. Too much time spent sitting inside playing games causes poor diet and lack of exercise leading to obesity, as shown in this picture. </p>
        <p>The photo on slide fourteen is a photo of children running around and playing, while a child in the front is excluded, left isolated and alone. This represents how gaming addiction leads to a lack of social skills, and a lack of interest for socialization with others. In this example, the child is missing out on all the fun because of how gaming has affected their behaviour.  </p>
        <p>The photo on slide fifteen shows the stages of addiction, which applies to gaming addiction as well. This represents the idea that gaming can be just like any other addiction, and all addiction end with dependence.  </p>
        <p>The photo on slide sixteen is a photo of a wallet with no money in it. This is to demonstrate the point that when one is addicted to gaming, they tend to spend a lot of money on games and in game purchases. Another point is that when all time is spent playing video games, there is less time to work and make money. This leads to financial issues.</p>
        <p>The photo on slide seventeen is a photo of someone sitting inside playing games, while there is a beautiful sunset outside. This demonstrates the lost opportunity for real life experience, because of gaming.  </p>
        <p>The photo on slide eightin is a photo of a man in a therapy counselling session. Therapy can be needed for some people to quit a gaming addiction. Gaming can take over almost anyone’s lives if they get too attached.</p>
        <p>The last photo in our presentation is a photo of a family intervention for a man’s gaming addiction. This is because support from friends and family can be a great way to beat an addiction such as a gaming addiction.</p>
