    <h1>Gaming Addiction</h1>
    <h3>Photo essay by Liam, Andrei, Jordan, Cameron</h3>
    <section>
        <h2> Gaming addiction</h2>
        <p>The photo on slide 7 shows a student sleeping in a classroom, while others are studying. This photo is a good example of how gaming addiction can have a negative effect on academic performance and overall well-being. </p>
        <p>The next slide shows an office worker who is in distress; the tone of the photograph perfectly conveys a somber atmosphere showing the impact of excessive gaming on performance in a workplace.</p>
        <p>The photo on slide 9 shows a person who is taking competitive games too seriously, highlighting how addictive online games can be and how they can cause anger management problems.</p>
        <p> The next set of photos shows how the rise of online gaming has reduced the need to socialize and visit friends. The first photo shows two friends having fun and playing video games together and the second one portrays a person playing alone in a dimly lit room; 
            darker tones are used for contrast and convey the feeling of solitude</p>
        <p>The photo on slide 11 shows a person “glued” to the screen without paying attention to the food they consume, this situation shows how gaming can develop bad eating habits.</p>
        <p>First it starts as just something to try but soon enough you'll be using it regularly, you'll start to depend on it to be happy, you will start to use it to avoid your problems and then you'll be addicted.</p>
        <p>You will have no money due to the amount you are spending on the games you will want. Plus the price of games have gotten much higher so just for a game you could be spending up to 80-120 dollars for each.</p>
        <p>With gaming you're distracted from what's going on in your real life,  so you are losing all the opportunities you could be getting because with games you can easily get lost into and lose contact with reality </p>
        <p>Therapy could end up being mandatory with how quickly you can be depending on gaming. A lot of people who play video games too much need to get therapy because all they wanna do all day is games and it slowly destroys themself with every week that goes by of you just constantly playing.</p>
